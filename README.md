# Random-Quotes
This is a PHP code that generates a random quote from a pre-defined list of quotes. The code randomly selects a quote from an array of quotes and displays it on the webpage. The quotes are stored in an array of associative arrays, each containing the author, text, and image of the quote. The code then selects a random quote from the array and displays it on the webpage. The author and text of the quote are displayed in a blockquote element, and the image is displayed below the quote. The code is written in PHP and HTML and can be used to add a random quote generator to any webpage.
